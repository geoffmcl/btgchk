Run a series of checks on `*.btg.gz` files, Scenery v2.+, ie current terragear, TerraSync server... airport and index based...

If anomolies found, write corrected *-new.bgt.gz, for review, ... like -

 - Repair the mesh...
 - Cut airport holes...
 - Check bordering buckets match...
 
Of course, in due course, over time, these **generated** glitches, will be resolved, fixed, discussed, decided, ... in the `terragear` tool chain...

But seems good to have an independant view... is C, .... does not use SimGear binobj...

Does not handle `fans`, `stripes`, but it is assumed there are none in the v.2.? data...

In some cases, can provide a quick fix, until the **next** scenery generation, is under steam... online...

Thanks @reiszner...
